# Student-Performance-Analyzer
A Django-based Student Performance Analyzer that processes Excel datasets to identify slow learners, weak subjects, and improvement areas. It provides topic explanations, a preparation timer with email reminders, dynamic quizzes, score comparison, and sends parent notifications if the studentâ€™s performance does not improve.
